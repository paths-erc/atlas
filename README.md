PAThs is an ERC granted project (Advanced Grant 2015, project number 687567, P.I. Paola Buzi), aimed at providing an in-depth diachronic understanding and effective representation of the geography of Coptic literary and manuscript production and, in particular, of the corpus of literary writings, almost exclusively of religious content, produced in Egypt between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries in the Coptic language. PAThs takes an original and pluridisciplinary approach, combining philology, codicology, palaeography, archaeology and digital humanities, in order to explore the process of production, copying, usage, dissemination and storage of Coptic works in relation to the geographical contexts of origin of both the texts themselves and their related writing supports.

The **Archaeological Atlas of Coptic Literature** if an open access project, free to use.


## Disclaimer

The Archaeological Atlas of Coptic Literature is still in progress, therefore many features might not be yet available or work as expected. Our datasets are growing on a daily basis, and will continue to grow in the next years.

Please, feel free to report any malfunction, breakdown, omission, error you might encounter during your work session, by writing to [paola.buzi@uniroma1.it](mailto:paola.buzi@uniroma1.it) or [opening a new issue](https://github.com/paths-erc/atlas/issues/new).

The Atlas is meant to become a tool useful for the whole scholarly community, and its completeness and correctness also depends on the contribution of users.
