The section **Places** of the PAThs database contains an up-to-date catalogue of Late-Antique Egyptian sites active between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 11<sup>th</sup> century.

Places are firstly intended as physical spatial units that can be archaeologically observed and documented, i.e., they can be linked to a tangible area, with a (more or less) precise location, and a distinctive configuration of material remains. Special attention is accorded to sites related with the production, circulation, storage, preservation and discovery of manuscripts.
Finally, major political, religious and cultural centres (like the episcopal sees), which are relevant for the reconstruction of the landscape of Byzantine Egypt, are also included, even though they do no longer preserve archaeological traces.

Each place is assigned a unique identifying number and a standard site-name(s), which correspond(s) to the most common designation(s) by which the site is mentioned in scholarly literature. The following fields are designed to provide as detailed and complete information as possible about its historical development, geo-topographical localisation, urban setting and monumental features. The main data recorded are:

-	toponyms, both ancient and modern, by which the place is known in the different linguistic contexts of reference (Coptic, Greek, modern Arabic and ancient Egyptian)
-	link to online parallel projects (Trismegistos GeoID and Pleiades ID) as well as cross-reference to Timm’s inventory
- modern geographical location according to different scale degree (Region; Area)
- ancient administrative affiliations (nomòs; province, according to the Diocletianic division of the country; episcopal see). For the Fayyum area, a specific reference to the merides-system is also recorded.
-	site type (one category from the list adopted by PAThs; see vocabulary), its spatial and/or historical relationships with other places
-	dating of the Coptic phase within the chronological range of reference and the criteria upon which the attribution is based
-	brief description of the site summing up its main topographical and historical features as documented in the extant archaeological record
-	direct link to related **Manuscripts**
-	geo-localisation of the site as marked by its geographical coordinates
-	preceding and possibly subsequent phases to the Coptic occupation

**Places** can be browsed and searched in different ways, among which the easiest and most intuitive ones are by:

-	Site name
-	Other toponyms by which the site is known
-	Reference to the geo-topographical areas or administrative units
-	Site-type

Places offers an unusual but stimulating perspective to the study of Coptic literary manuscript culture; since manuscripts are related to different places by many qualified connections (production, storage, discovery, etc.), geography and archaeology can positively contribute to (re-)materialise the contexts of their production and circulation, thus providing an effective representation of the historical and cultural environment of the intellectual work of literary creation. Ultimately, places represent active factors in the process of development of Coptic literature and they need, consequently, to be accurately identified and documented.
