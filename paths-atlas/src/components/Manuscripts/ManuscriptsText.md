Books, which in ancient times means manuscript books, are the privileged vehicle of diffusion and knowledge of a literature, that is of a culture. But, as it has been observed, every book has its destiny, and the destiny of Coptic manuscripts has been a very capricious one. At first, after many centuries of flourishing production, the neglect: when Coptic became definitely a dead language, superseded by the Arabic, ancient Coptic manuscripts were not more consulted and in some cases were even relegated in remote storerooms of the monasteries. Then, when the monks realized that those (in their opinion) unuseful relics raised the interest of many Western collectors, they felt no scruple to dismember them and sell to different persons quires, leaves and even fragments, in order to increase the incomes. So it happens that manuscripts from the same ancient library (e.g. the library of the White Monastery, or of the Monastery of Saint Macarius), and even portions of a single manuscript, are scattered in a lot of manuscript collections all over the world. In earlier decades, many efforts have been made to reconstruct the composition of the dispersed Coptic libraries and of their often dismembered manuscripts, which are better called ‘codicological units’. Moreover, archaeological explorations and more or less fortuitous finds made by the natives, have greatly enriched our knowledge of the Coptic book production, especially of its earlier phases (e.g. the Nag Hammadi Codices, the Bodmer Papyri, but also the manuscripts from the Monastery of the Archangel Michael near Phantoou).

This section of the PAThs database lists all the Coptic and bilingual Greco-Coptic ‘codicological units’, dated or datable from the 3<sup>rd</sup> to the 11<sup>th</sup> century.

Each codicological unit is identified by a new, stable and unique ID, called ‘Coptic Literary Manuscript’ (CLM). When the codicological units have been already classified and/or described by other projects (CMCL mainly, but also Trismegistos, LDAB, Digital Edition of Coptic Old Testament) a reference to the respective ID is always provided.

Each CLM is linked to the related

- Titles
- Colophons
- Places of production and/or storage and/or discovery.

The cornerstone on which the PAThs manuscript database has been built is the CMCL, which preserves an enormous and valuable amount of data. PAThs catalogue contains all the codicological units repertoried in the CMCL, but updates and enriches it with significant additions, such as:
- the manuscripts discovered in the most recent archaeological campaigns (e.g. the hermitage of Sheikh el-Gurna, or MMA 1152, in Western Thebes; Antinoopolis),
- the ostraca from the Theban region (for which we have a well documented archaeological context),
- detached bindings (that is bindings without a related text block).

On the contrary, PAThs database does not include:
- Copto-Arabic manuscripts,
- liturgical manuscripts (except those already included in the CMCL, mainly from the White Monastery),
- non-literary manuscripts of magical and astrological content.

When only one or a few fragments of an original ‘codicological unit’ survive, these are classified per se, being temporary considered as ‘codicological units’, until other complementary fragments have been identified and a CLM ID has been assigned to the virtually reconstructed codex.

The database provides also a new detailed protocol of codicological description, elaborated by the PAThs team: it takes into account the most recent theoretical and terminological achievements of Greek and Latin codicology, but is of course commensurate to the specific features of Coptic manuscripts. An analytical description of the codicological protocol is provided in the “Manual of use”.
This model of description is easily expandable in case of need to describe new features and can be easily queried (manually or programmatically), in order to provide scholars with an easy-to-use tool for their research.

So far (February 2019), the user can find a complete codicological description, which also includes the bibliography, of the few Coptic papyrus and parchment rolls, and of the codicological units belonging to some of the most important ancient libraries of Chrstian Egypt, that is:
- Nag Hammadi Codices,
- Bodmer Papyri (otherwise called Dishna Papers),
- papyrus codices from the Monastery of Saint John the Baptist of Tin,
- codices from the hermitage of Sheikh el-Gurna,
- codices from Antinoopolis,
- parchment codices from the Monastery of the Archangel Michael near Phantoou,
- parchment codices from the Monastery of Saint Macarius in the Wadi al-Natrun.
