This section of the “PAThs” Database contains the edition, with English translation, of the entire corpus of the extant Coptic colophons written between the 7<sup>th</sup> and the 11<sup>th</sup> century.

Colophons are directly linked to the related manuscripts by means of the CLM ID as well as dedicated colophon ID.

Information about dating, dialect, linguistic peculiarities, presence of Greek subscriptions, cryptographies, as well as a brief palaeographical description (layout, writing features as axis, presence of thick-and-thin style, presence of Coptic or Greek minuscule) are also provided.

Coptic colophons can be browsed and searched in different ways, among which the easiest and most intuitive ones are by:
- Dating
- Dialect
- CLM ID
- Prosopographical data (mainly copyist, donor, commemorated person, leading clergymen etc.)

Moreover, the Coptic text of the colophons as well as their English translations are fully searchable, enabling a detailed survey on plenty of linguistic items and positive contents.

The electronic edition of colophons is made by using Unicode encoding standard and Antinoou font. The ecdotic criteria are those established by the *Leydener Klammersystem*. The Egyptian month names are rendered in their Coptic form, the toponyms and the anthroponyms are transcribed phonetically.

Beyond their inherent value as *Schenkungsurkunden* of the manuscript, Coptic colophons, as every documentary text, offer plenty of data about Medieval Egypt. They disclose to us copious evidence of the cultural, confessional, economic and social milieus where the books were produced, sold, acquired, preserved and used as well as the routes manuscripts often embarked on.
