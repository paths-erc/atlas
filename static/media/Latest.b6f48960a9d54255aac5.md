The following are some of the main results achieved by the PAThs project in the last year.

#### Manuscripts: codicological units and bookbindings

Completed the codicological description of the Vatican collection of liturgical/homiletic manuscripts from the Monastery of San Macarius (Vat. copt. 57-69, autoptic analysis), and that of the Manichaean codices from Medinet Madi.

Almost completed the codicological description of the so-called “Edfu Collection” and the Vatican Borg. copt. collection (autoptic analysis).

Several bookbindings described in the “Manuscripts” section. Unfortunately, latest reports confirm that some of the known bindings have been lost ([CLM 686](manuscripts/686), [CLM 6501](manuscripts/6501), [CLM 6502](manuscripts/6502), [CLM 6503](manuscripts/6503), [CLM 6504](manuscripts/6504), [CLM 6508](manuscripts/6508), [CLM 6509](manuscripts/6509)), but more previously unknown bindings have surfaced at the Chester Beatty Library.


#### Authors and Works

Biographical accounts and lists of the related Coptic and Greek works, with brief discussions of the most relevant ongoing issues, are now available for about 80% of the [Coptic ‘authors’ recorded by PAThs](search/authors/all).


#### Colophons and Persons (attested in colophons)

Corpus of colophons completely revised and integrated with new texts; list of persons extended to more typological categories (Marta Addessi).


#### Titles

More than 800 titles—initial, final, running titles and section headings—included and described in the [“Titles” section](search/titles/all).


#### Archaeology and Geography

[Section “Places”](search/places/all) of the Atlas, which currently consists of 461 records, recently updated with the complete publication of 101 sites of the Delta, including a large number of surveyed archaeological contexts (Tell/Kom). A detailed review of monastic places named as Deir/Dayr is also under way.

New raster base-maps of Egypt and Sudan now free available as XYZ service:
- [Anglo/Egyptian Sudan, scale 1:250k](https://docs.paths-erc.eu/data/#sudan_1_250_000_/_anglo_egyptian_sudan)
- [Soviet Military topographic Map, scale 1:200k](https://docs.paths-erc.eu/data/#soviet_military_topographic_maps_1_200_000__1985)
- [Soviet Military topographic Map, scale 1:500k](https://docs.paths-erc.eu/data/#soviet_military_topographic_maps_1_500_000__1954)

These maps, and the other datasets worked by the PAThs Team, can be freely accessed directly from the [PAThs data repository portal](https://docs.paths-erc.eu/data/) with the license indicated in the corresponding reports.
