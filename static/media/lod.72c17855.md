**PAThs** has developed a dedicated output channel to export and make available
its data using Linked Open Data technologies.

A collaboration has been developed with the [Pelagios Commons](http://commons.pelagios.org/)
initiative to publish structured data in the [Peripleo](http://peripleo.pelagios.org/about)
platform, «a community network that facilitates linking of online resources that
document the past, based on the places they refer to».

At present a [VoID file](https://github.com/pelagios/pelagios-cookbook/wiki/Joining-Pelagios#the-void-file)
is being maintained on our [web database](https://db-dev.bradypus.net/api/paths/places?verb=pelagios-void)
among with the main real-time export file of Places in the following formats:
- [turtle](https://db-dev.bradypus.net/api/paths/places?verb=search&type=encoded&q_encoded=MSBMSU1JVCAwLCA1MDA=&fullRecords=true&format=turtle)
- [json](https://db-dev.bradypus.net/api/paths/places?verb=search&type=encoded&q_encoded=MSBMSU1JVCAwLCA1MDA=&fullRecords=true&format=json)
- [ntriples](https://db-dev.bradypus.net/api/paths/places?verb=search&type=encoded&q_encoded=MSBMSU1JVCAwLCA1MDA=&fullRecords=true&format=ntriples)
- [rdfxml](https://db-dev.bradypus.net/api/paths/places?verb=search&type=encoded&q_encoded=MSBMSU1JVCAwLCA1MDA=&fullRecords=true&format=rdfxml)
- [dot](https://db-dev.bradypus.net/api/paths/places?verb=search&type=encoded&q_encoded=MSBMSU1JVCAwLCA1MDA=&fullRecords=true&format=dot)
