**PAThs** has developed a dedicated output channel to export and make available
its data using Linked Open Data technologies.

A collaboration has been developed with the [Pelagios Commons](http://commons.pelagios.org/)
initiative to publish structured data in the [Peripleo](http://peripleo.pelagios.org/about)
platform, «a community network that facilitates linking of online resources that
document the past, based on the places they refer to».

At present a [VoID file](https://github.com/pelagios/pelagios-cookbook/wiki/Joining-Pelagios#the-void-file),
and the dump of Places in turtle formats
is being maintained on our [web GitHub repository](https://github.com/paths-erc/docs/tree/master/data).
