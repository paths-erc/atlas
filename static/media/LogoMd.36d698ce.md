The complex nature of the numerous scientific disciplines involved in ‘PAThs’ — philology, codicology, and literature on the one side and archaeology, archaeometry, and geography on the other — is well represented by its logo, which is inspired by the devotional footprints inscribed by pilgrims, monks, and devout people, not necessarily Christian, all over Egypt in Late Antiquity, in order to mark their presence in places that were considered important for the religious life (PAThs < ⲣⲁⲧ = ‘footprint’, ‘trace’).
