“PAThs” makes available freely the contents of its database in different
formats and for different purposes. Presently, RDF triples following the
[Pelagios Gazetteer Interconnection Format](https://github.com/pelagios/pelagios-cookbook/wiki/Pelagios-Gazetteer-Interconnection-Format)
are available for download, in different formats. Other dump formats (CSV and SQL)
will be published on a regular basis.

Data can be downloaded as versioned, static files hosted on GitHub or can also be
programmatically harvested using the [BraDypUS database API](https://docs.bdus.cloud/api/).
