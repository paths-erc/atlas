This section of the **PAThs** database contains a catalogue of Late Antique Egyptian sites active between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> centuries.

Places are firstly intended as physical spatial units that can be archaeologically observed and documented, i.e., they can be referred to a tangible area, with a specific topographical location and a distinctive configuration of material remains. Special attention is accorded to sites connected to the production, circulation, storage, preservation and discovery of manuscripts. Finally, major political, religious and cultural centres (for instance the episcopal sees), which are relevant for the reconstruction of the landscape of Byzantine Egypt, are also recorded, even though they no longer preserve archaeological traces. Likewise, toponyms attested in **Colophons** but lacking a certain localisation are included as a valuable outcome of the edition of that corpus, which provides, among the others, significant information on the geographical circulation of manuscripts.

Each Place is assigned a unique identifying number and a standard site name, which corresponds to the most common designation used in scholarly literature. The following fields are designed to provide as detailed and complete information as possible about its historical development, geo-topographical localisation, urban setting and monumental features. The main data recorded are:

-	Toponyms, both ancient and modern, by which the place is known in the different linguistic contexts of reference (Coptic, Greek, modern Arabic and ancient Egyptian). As for the site name, the romanised spelling of Arabic toponyms of monastic sites follow the oral pronunciation (Deir), which appears more commonly used in literature, and not the script of the original language (Dayr). The latter form, however, is always recorded in the list of other place names
-	Link to online parallel projects ([Trismegistos GeoID](https://www.trismegistos.org/geo/index.php) and [Pleiades ID](https://pleiades.stoa.org/)) as well as cross-reference to Timm’s inventory (*Das christlich-koptische Ägypten in arabischer Zeit*, Wiesbaden 1984-1992)
-	Modern geographical location according to different scale degree (Region, Area)
-	Ancient administrative affiliations (nomòs; province, according to the Diocletianic division of the country; episcopal see). For the Fayyum area, a specific reference to the *merides*-system is also recorded
-	Site typology and its spatial and/or historical relationships with other places
-	Dating of the Coptic phase within the chronological range of reference and the criteria upon which the attribution is based
-	Brief description of the site summing up its main topographical and historical features as documented in the extant archaeological record
- Geo-localisation of the site as marked by its geographical coordinates
-	Preceding and possibly subsequent phases to the Late Antique occupation

**Places** are linked to **Manuscripts**.

**Places** offer an unusual but stimulating perspective to the study of Coptic literary manuscript culture. Since manuscripts might be related to different places by many qualified connections (production, storage, discovery, etc.), geography and archaeology can positively contribute to (re-)materialise the contexts of their production and circulation, thus providing an effective representation of the historical and cultural environment of the intellectual work of literary creation. Ultimately, **Places** represent active factors in the process of development of Coptic literature and they need, consequently, to be accurately identified and documented.
