This section of the **PAThs** database contains the literary works preserved in the Coptic language, even including the fragmentary ones, both original compositions and translations of Greek works. They are recorded and identified by the *Clavis Coptica* (CC) entries composed of a 4-digit number preceded by, for example, CC 0599, assigned by the [*Corpus dei Manoscritti Copti Letterari*](http://www.cmcl.it/). The *clavis*  system allows univocal identification of each text, since the modern conventional denominations, traditionally expressed in Latin (e.g., *Historia Ecclesiastica*), as well as the ancient *inscriptiones*/*subscriptiones* (initial titles/final titles) attested in the manuscripts, are rarely reliable.

Currently, about 1050 works are recorded, but their number is constantly growing because of new textual discoveries and identifications.

Each CC entry is related to a system of multiple identifiers including, when available, all the more relevant *claves*:
- *Clavis Patrum Graecorum* (CPG),
- *Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca* (BHG),
- *Bibliotheca Hagiographica Orientalis* (BHO),
- *Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina* (BHL),
- *Clavis Apocryphorum Veteris Testamenti* (CAVT),
- *Clavis Apocryphorum Novi Testamenti* (CANT),
- *Clavis Aethiopica* (CAe).

Consequently, it is possible to relate each Coptic work to equivalent/parallel works preserved in other literary traditions and languages, thus sketching a map of the dissemination  of each work and legacy in other linguistic, geographical and cultural domains.

**Works** are linked to the **Manuscripts**, where they are preserved, and are closely related to **Authors**. According to the **PAThs** classification, an author can be linked to an individual single work as:
- Stated Author: author to which a work is attributed in the Coptic manuscript tradition
- Work’s Creator: actual and original author of the work in its original language, either Greek or Coptic
- Author of the Master Work: author of a work in the Coptic literary tradition that has been redrafted to such an extent that it is considered as an independent work  (eg. the excerpt from the *Republic* of Plato preserved in the Nag Hammadi Codex VI = CC 0689)

These identifications draw on textual (the content itself), paratextual (titles, colophons, other scribal subscriptions) and/or external evidence (other works, historiographical traditions, etc.) that is always clearly recorded.

A provisional periodisation system, object of further amendments and changes, is here proposed for the primary purpose of guiding the user within the complex Coptic literary manuscript tradition. This periodization is based on a fresh assessment of the classification of Coptic literature elaborated by Tito Orlandi (T. Orlandi, *Letteratura copta e Cristianesimo nazionale egiziano*, in A. Camplani (ed.), *Egitto cristiano. Aspetti e problemi in età tardo-antica*, Roma 1997, 39-120; http://www.cmcl.it/), enriched with new interpretations by Anne Boud’hors (A. Boud’hors, *The Coptic Tradition*, in S.F. Johnson (ed.), *The Oxford Handbook of Late Antiquity*, Oxford 2012, 224-246).
