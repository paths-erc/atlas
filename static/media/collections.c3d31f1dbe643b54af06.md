This section of the PAThs database contains the collections from all over the world—libraries, museums and private collections—housing Coptic manuscripts, be they complete or (more often) fragmentary.

Each **Collection** is provided with an internal identifier and is referred to with its full name, which includes the country (e.g. United Kingdom), the town (e.g. London), the name of the institution (e.g. BL) and name of the fund (e.g. Or.).

**Collections** are linked to the related **Manuscripts**.
