This section of the **PAThs** database contains the authors attested in the Coptic manuscript tradition. Currently, there are 114 authors to whom one or more works are attributed.

Each **Author** entry is identified by a `unique internal number` (ID) and provides:
- The Virtual International Authority File ([VIAF](http://viaf.org/)) identifier
- The different forms of the Coptic name of the author, as they actually appear in the Coptic titles
- The Greek name, when available
- The English version of the name
- Any religious or ecclesiastical title, when available
- Chronological references, when available
- A short biography of the author, focused on his impact on the development of Coptic literature, with a discussion of his more relevant extant works
- A thorough *regestum* of the extant literary works attributed to the author, both in Coptic and in other oriental Christian languages
- A selected bibliography

As for the Greek authors, only the works actually written in Coptic are recorded, distinguishing the authentic works from the pseudo-epigraphical ones.

As for the Coptic authors—namely, authors whose works were probably composed originally in Coptic—both the works preserved in Coptic (*genuina* and *dubia*/*spuria*) and their translations in other languages are recorded.

The biographical accounts, the lists of the literary works attributed to the author, as well as the related *Clavis Coptica* entries, are subject to ongoing and regular updates and should be not considered definitive.

**Authors** includes real, fictitious and semi-fictitious personalities. The last category refers to common Coptic phenomenon, i.e. the literary construction of semi-historical characters made up of a mixture of reliable biographical information and fabricated additions, often for evident apologetic or defamatory purposes. This phenomenon led, *inter alia*, to the formation of the so-called “cycles”—groups of works composed at relatively late stages of Coptic literature and devoted to the lives of 4th and 5th century fathers.

**Authors** are linked to **Works**, which are linked to **Manuscripts** preserving them.
