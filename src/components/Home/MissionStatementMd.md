In brief, the **PAThs** philosophy can be described using three key concepts `sharing`, `synergy` and `common ground`.


### Sharing

The **PAThs** team strongly believes that the sharing of ideas, achievements and results is the only ethical and fruitful way to do research. It is also the best means to create a virtuous collaboration network involving projects with similar or complementary purposes, and to encourage the contribution of all stakeholders. For this reason all the data contained in the **PAThs** database are freely accessible, reusable and exportable. We would be grateful, however, if users would refer to its use in their publications making use of the appropriate identifiers (URIs) and resource location (URLs).
Any suggestion useful to the construction and perfection of the ‘geography of Coptic literature’ is very much welcome.

### Synergy

There is no reason to retrace the paths of research already successfully explored by others. Whenever possible, therefore, **PAThs** takes advantage of the results achieved by other projects (CMCL, Trismegistos, Pleaides, Virtual International Authority, etc.), by perfectly integrating their results without pointless overlapping. This allows us, through a mutual exchange of data, to plan and build new paths into unexplored territories, such as, for example, the relationship between Coptic literary manuscripts and the physical space (i.e. archaeological context) where they have been produced, circulated, stored and finally found.
Connection points with other projects—such as specific IDs attributed to places or manuscripts, to give but one example—are of course always clearly acknowledged.

### Common ground

With no claim to have the last word—which would be pretentious and not plausible—**PAThs** hopes to provide useful methods, models and tools on which further historical, literary, codicological, and archaeological research related to Christian Egypt may be based.
Any scientific decision taken within the project is the result of long and meticulous reflection, based also on the experience of affiliated collaborators, and will be thoroughly explained and motivated, so that users may decide if it is convincing enough to be adopted.

## What can you find in PAThs?

An articulated list is provided below of what you can or will be soon be able to find in **PAThs** databases and repositories:

### 1. A digital Archaeological Atlas of Coptic Literature
(see also below section: 6. A classification and description of all the physical places related the production, storage and circulation of ‘codicological units’ and ‘bibliological units’, available on the Archaeological Atlas of Coptic Literature)
The Atlas contains and displays:
- sites where Coptic manuscripts have been found
- sites where Coptic manuscripts have been produced
- sites where Coptic manuscripts have circulated
- sites where Coptic manuscripts have been stored and preserved in
antiquity
- episcopal sees, very often coinciding with administrative ‘capitals’ of
former pharaonic nomoi
- sites mentioned by Coptic titles and colophons
- sites that, although not related to manuscripts, can help in the
reconstruction of the landscape of late antique and early mediaeval Egypt.

The Atlas is searchable by multiple keys (manuscript identifiers, fragment identifiers, work identifiers, author names, places of production/circulation/ storage, etc.) both by using pre-built forms or by browsing the dynamically created maps.

### 2. A complete repertory and classification of the ‘codicological units’ pertaining to Coptic literature

A CLM (Coptic Literary Manuscript) identifier has been assigned to each `codicological unit` and, whenever possible, it is stated if it corresponds to a `Production unit` (UniProd) or to a `Circulation unit` (UniCirc). When the `codicological units` have been already classified and/or described by other projects (CMCL mainly, but also Trismegistos, LDAB, Digital Edition of Coptic Old Testament) a reference to their identifiers is always provided. When only one or a few fragments of an original `codicological unit` survive, these are classified per se, being temporary considered as `codicological units`, until other complementary fragments have been identified and a CMCL *siglum* or an CLM ID has been assigned to the virtually reconstructed codex.


### 3. An accurate protocol of codicological description of the codicological units

Since, after a careful exploration of the available models for codicological description, no satisfactory examples were found—at least for the specific purposes of the Coptic manuscript tradition—a detailed protocol for the description of Coptic ‘codicological units’ has been elaborated, based on both the most recent theoretical and terminological achievements and reflection of Greek and Latin codicology and on the specific necessities and **status quaestionis** of Coptic manuscript studies (for the terminology cf. Patrick Andrist, Paul Canart, Marilena Maniaci (eds.), *La syntaxe du codex: essai de codicologie structurale*, Turnhout: Brepols, 2013).

This protocol of description is easily expandable in case of need to describe new features and can be easily queried (manually or programmatically), in order to provide scholars with an easy-to-use tool for their research.

### 4. An annotated list and reasoned classification of the authors related to Coptic literature

As it is well known, not all the author names related to literary works are “Coptic” and some of them are fictitious or semi-fictitious. Moreover, there are cases of works with missing titles, whose author can therefore only be deduced from the tradition or from the work’s content. Finally many author attributions found in the titles cannot be considered authentic. After a long reflection, authors attribution has therefore been classified according to the following categories which, as it is obvious, can be combined:
- Creator: original author of the work, no matter if this was originally
written in Greek and translated into Coptic at a later time.
- Stated author: Author to whom a work is attributed by the title, the
content of the work itself, the scribal subscription or other paratexts. The source for the attribution of a specific work to a specific author is always clearly stated. 
A stated author may or may not coincide with the creator and it may or may not be fictitious (this information is clearly recorded and stored).

Each author is identified by a **PAThs** stable identifier. When available, reference to VIAF (Virtual International Authority File) identifiers is regularly made.

The authors’ names are provided in their English, Coptic and Greek forms; the Coptic form reflects the spelling found in the titles of Coptic manuscripts.

### 5. A complete list of Coptic literary works

A full list of Coptic literary works, completed with CMCL stable identifiers (Clavis Coptica) is provided. Other identifiers, when available, are implemented in order to obtain a full map to all available on/off line resources.
The principal sources of external identifiers are:
- CPG Clavis Patrum Graecorum
- CANT Clavis Apocryphorum Novi Testamenti
- CAVT Clavis Apocryphorum Veteris Testamenti
- BHO Bibliotheca Hagiographica Orientalis
- BHG Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca
- BHL Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina
- CAe Clavis Aethiopica

The definition of “Coptic literary works” also includes texts of the Bible, Gnostica, Manichaica and Apochrypha. Ostraca of biblical content are always excluded.

### 6. A classification and description of all the physical places related to the production, storage and circulation of codicological units and bibliological units, available in the Archaeological Atlas of Coptic Literature

(See also section 1. A digital Archaeological Atlas of Coptic Literature)
A rich set of ‘places’ related to manuscripts and works is considered and thoroughly described in a dedicated database. The following categories are so far provided:

- Place of provenance: each `codicological unit` is to be referred to a specific area of provenance, more or less accurate and precise (from a large cultural or administrative region to a precise room of a settlement) depending mainly on reliability of the available data: archaeological reports, notes of purchase, archive information, internal/stylistic elements, contents, palaeography, etc.). 
The source of information used for the geolocation is always clearly stated.
-  Place of discovery: `codicological units`, or part of them, are provided
with information concerning their discovery, when available, obtained
by archaeological reports, surveys, notes of travellers, sketches, etc.
- Displacement and circulation: when available (useful information can be obtained by scribal subscriptions) the displacement and circulation of
`codicological units` and `bibliological units` are carefully mapped.
The principal aim of this database is to provide each `codicological unit` with at least one physical location, in order to properly display it on a map. `Codicological units` that in any way cannot be georeferenced will however be listed separately, even if these manuscripts cannot be displayed on the Archaeological Atlas of Coptic Literature.

### 7. A selection of marked-up texts

A [selected corpus](https://github.com/paths-erc/coptic-texts) of hagiographic and homiletic texts—that are consistent and homogeneous in terms of cultural and literary milieu, period and genre —are being marked-up, in order to:
- provide useful geographical information for the Archaeological Atlas of
Coptic Literature (places, architectural typologies, historical characters,
heresiological groups, etc.);
- put at disposal of other scholars a public repository of open-access
annotated texts useful for any further research.
The selection has been made considering the geographical proximity of their creation, the chronological and cultural context, that is the monastic homogeneous environment of the so-called Middle Egypt. All the selected texts were already available in electronic version in the CMCL database. The texts selected so far are:
- CC 0084: Basil of Pemge, In Longinum
- [CC 0152: Vita Pauli Tamma](https://github.com/paths-erc/coptic-texts/blob/master/cc0152.xml)
- CC 0248: Paul of Tamma, Epistula
- CC 0251: Paul of Tamma, De cella
- [CC 0256: Vita Phif, Vita Apollinis](https://github.com/paths-erc/coptic-texts/blob/master/cc0256.xml)
- CC 0376: Stephen of Hnes, In Apollinem archimandritam
- [CC 0418: Vita Longini](https://github.com/paths-erc/coptic-texts/blob/master/cc0418.xml)
- [CC 0407: Vita Aphou](https://github.com/paths-erc/coptic-texts/blob/master/cc0407.xml)

The electronic edition of texts uses Unicode encoding standard and Antinoou font and does not represent the punctuation and the enlarged initials. A specific text encoding converter is being used for this purpose (see section 10. Text encoding converter).

### 8. A complete census, edition and translation of Coptic titles

A full edition and English translation of the entire corpus of titles—initial, final or intermediate—produced between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 13<sup>th</sup> century is provided.

Coptic titles represent a privileged point of observation of the Coptic literary manuscript culture. Over the centuries, their position inside the manuscripts, layout, length, textual structure and even purpose has changed many times, marking crucial changes in the manufacture of the writing supports, e.g. the shift from roll to codex, and from papyrus codex to parchment codex, and marking also important passages of the history of Coptic literature, from the translations from Greek into Coptic to the production of an original literature. Moreover, the titles have often been created in a later moment than the works they are attributed to and therefore can be considered texts in their own right. A first classification of titles has already been published, but it requires updating and enlarging.

It must be stressed that Coptic titles do not represent a trustworthy coordinate for identification of a work (for this purpose the Clavis Coptica is the only possible reliable ID), since, in addition to what has just been described, it is not rare for the same work to have circulated with different titles in different manuscripts. The titles however represent a valuable indicator of the formation process of Coptic literature and for this reason it is important for them to be accurately classified.

As far as the contents are concerned, the following data will be marked-up: authors, historical and fictional characters, biblical characters, national groups, orthodox and heterodox religious groups, bibliological terms, churches and other architectural buildings, monasteries, civil and ecclesiastical ranks, emperors, ethnics, monasteries, months, professions, readers, saints, sultans, towns. The Egyptian month names will be rendered in their Greek form.

The electronic edition of titles is made by using Unicode encoding standard and Antinoou font and does not represent the punctuation and the enlarged initials, in order to have texts that, if necessary, are more easily searchable and analysable.

### 9. A complete census, edition and translation of Coptic colophons or scribal subscriptions

A full edition and English translation of the entire corpus of colophons produced between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 11<sup>th</sup> century is providedSince colophons remain halfway between a literary text and a document, their edition adheres to the convention of papyrological publications.
The original layout of the text has been simplified for the purpose of the electronic edition and the actual features of the writing have been rendered through the adoption of the Leidener Klammersystem, i.e. <span class="coptic">ⲁ̣ ⲃ̣ ⲅ̣</span> indicate letters of uncertain reading, ̣ ̣ ̣ or ± 3 illegible letters, the estimated number of which is expressed, \[ ̣ ̣ ̣ or ± 3\] missing letters, the estimated number of which is expressed, \[<span class="coptic">ⲁⲃⲅ</span>\] letters restored by the editor, <<span class="coptic">ⲁⲃⲅ</span>> additions due to the editor, (<span class="coptic">ⲁⲃⲅ</span>) resolution of abbreviations as well as meaning of a symbol, {<span class="coptic">ⲁⲃⲅ</span>} interpolations expunged by the editor, ⟦<span class="coptic">ⲁⲃⲅ</span>⟧ erasures due to the copyist, \`<span class="coptic">ⲁⲃⲅ</span>´ interlinear additions. Nomina sacra, symbols and abbreviations have always been solved.

Greek scribal subscriptions, written either in uncial or in minuscule hands, are rendered in Greek characters.
Egyptian calendar dates are always converted into the correspondent Gregorian calendar date. The Egyptian month names are rendered in their Greek form.

As far as the contents are concerned, the following data are marked up and extracted: annus Martyrum, annus mundi, archangels, authors, Biblical characters, bibliological terms, churches, civilian ranks, clergymen, clients / donors / their relatives, copyists, days, demons, districts, ecclesiastical ranks, emperors, ethnics, hamlets, heathen gods, hiǧrī year, honored passed away, hours, monasteries, months, Muslim names, professions, readers, saints, sultans, towns.

The electronic edition of colophons is made by using Unicode encoding standard and Antinoou font.


### 10. Text encoding converter

**PAThs** puts at disposal a web application that runs directly in the browser and has no dependencies on other software or particular operating systems (cross-platform), that converts text in Coptic language from Tito Orlandi’s encoding system (similar to what Betacode is to Greek polytone, based on ASCII 128 and coupled with Coptonew font) to standard Unicode, Coptic block, coupled usually with Antinou font from Everytype.

The CMCL to Unicode converter—still under active development— is available for free usage at http://paths.uniroma1.it/cmcl2unicode/index.html. Its source code is hosted on **PAThs** repository on Github (https://github.com/paths-erc/cmcl2unicode) and is released with open source license (MIT: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). All users are warmly invited to report any issue that might help further development at https:// github.com/paths-erc/cmcl2unicode/issues.
The converter is currently being used—and will continue to be used in the future—to parse and migrate Coptic texts from CMCL to **PAThs** databases and online repositories, specially for texts being marked up (see section 7. A selection of marked-up texts).


## What you will find in the future in PAThs?

Aside the work that is already finished or is still ongoing the following issues are a core priority of the **PAThs** project and will be faced in the near future:

- A complete list of names of copyists, with their parental relationship and
their scribal networks, and indication of the place where they practiced their work, on the basis of the information provided by the colophons.
- A complete list of names of historical characters, gods, ecclesiastic and civil titles and roles, religious groups, and other notabilia, as they appear in titles and colophons.
- A large-scale codicological description of the `codicological units` which at the moment is limited to a few cases.
- A complete list of ancient and modern `bibliological units`.

## What you will not find in PAThs?

There are some important research topics that, although of fundamental interest, cannot be directly addressed by **PAThs**, because they fall beyond the stated chronological or scientific borders of the **PAThs** project. These topics will certainly be considered but no original output is announced at present.

Information about Nubian sites are not included at present in the **PAThs** database.

### 1. Copto-Arabic manuscripts

At the moment **PAThs** does not include Copto-Arabic manuscripts, but an enlargement to this cultural phase of Coptic literature might be envisaged in the future.

### 2. Full texts of literary works

**PAThs** will not publish electronic corpora of texts, with the only exception of the selected group of literary works mentioned above, whose function is that of obtaining useful data for the **Archaeological Atlas of Coptic Literature** and, at the same time, representing a model for further research.

### 3. A linguistic mark-up of the texts

The linguistic markup of Coptic texts lies outside the aims of the **PAThs** project, since other partner projects are fully committed to this purpose.

### 4. Description of superlinear strokes

A satisfactory description of superlinear strokes is still missing and involves an extremely difficult task. This would require a detailed and comparative description and analysis of a large number of manuscripts, which would represent a project in its own right. Only on the basis of such a collection of data would it be auspicable, eventually, to construct an accurate typology— functional and graphic—of the superlinear strokes, if such a typology is possible.
For all these reasons **PAThs** keeps aside the description of superlinear strokes, not even adopting the basic classification proposed by Bentley Layton in his catalogue.

### 5. Detailed description of manuscript decoration and illustration

Decorations are roughly described in the manuscript database. Only basic information will be provided, leaving a detailed description aside since no art historians are in the **PAThs** team.

## What is the relationship between the Corpus dei Manoscritti Copti Letterari and PAThs?

Thanks to the generosity of Tito Orlandi, **PAThs** has been conceived taking advantage of the enormous amount of valuable data preserved in the CMCL, used as a solid foundation to build a new series of databases upon. These new databases will hopefully represent a change of perspective in the study of Coptic literature.

For the next years, as far as most of the codicological units are concerned, the CMCL and **PAThs** will grow in parallel and be kept synchronized, but clearly **PAThs** will move increasingly towards the study of the tight relationship between the Coptic book and the actual space where it has been produced, stored and found.

Moreover, **PAThs** classifies manuscripts and fragments that are not (yet) considered by the CMCL, mainly (but not exclusively) from recent archaeological excavations.

In brief, **PAThs** owes much to the CMCL, but it aims to go beyond its goals and in some cases is based on technical choices that are very different.
