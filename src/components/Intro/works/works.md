This sections contains all the literary works even fragmentary preserved in Coptic, both original compositions and translations of Greek works. They are recorded and identified according to a numerical *Clavis Coptica* (CC) entry.
Currently, the works recorded are about 1050, but their number is constantly growing because of new textual discoveries and identifications.
Each CC entry is related to a system of multiple identifiers, including, when available, all the more relevant claves: *Clavis Patrum Graecorum* (CPG), *Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca* (BHG), *Bibliotheca Hagiographica Orientalis* (BHO), *Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina* (BHL), *Clavis Apocryphorum Veteris Testamenti* (CAVT), *Clavis Apocryphorum Novi Testamenti* (CANT), *Clavis Aethiopica* (CAe).

The *clavis* system makes it possible to relate each Coptic work with the literary traditions and languages by which the same composition is preserved, offering a map of the work’s dissemination and legacy in other linguistic, geographical and cultural backgrounds.
In this respect, our option has been to provide the references to all the claves that either point to previous versions contributing to the formation of the Coptic work or indicate following translations which are in various ways related to and dependent upon the Coptic text.

Indeed, the modern conventional “denominations” – traditionally expressed in Latin (e.g., *Historia Ecclesiastica*) – attributed in our database on the basis of the designations provided by *Corpus dei Manoscritti Copti Letterari* or other resources and editions, as well as the ancient *inscriptiones*/*subscriptiones* (initial titles/final titles) ascribed in the manuscripts to their related works, are not reliable in identifying a text in a consistent and methodologically satisfying way. This state of affairs indicates the need for an in-depth analysis of the contents of each manuscript evidence of the Coptic textual tradition. Our Works, marked with an univocal CC entry, are always linked to the manuscript(s) in which they are preserved.

The section Works is closely related to the section Authors. In “PAThs” classification, an author can be linked to a single work as:

- `stated author`: the name to which a work is attributed in Coptic.
- `work’s creator`: actual and original author of the work in its original language, either Greek or Coptic.
- `author of the master work`: author of a work that has lost its original authorship, but continues to circulate in the Coptic literary tradition under a pseudoepigraphical attribution and in such a redrafted redaction that it has to be considered as a work independent of the original one.

These identifications can be built on textual (the content itself), paratextual (titles, colophons, other scribal subscriptions) and/or “external” evidence (other works, historiographical traditions, etc.), and this information is clearly recorded.
