This section of the **PAThs** database contains the edition, with English translation, of the entire corpus of the extant Coptic colophons written between the 7<sup>th</sup> and the 13<sup>th</sup> centuries.

The scribal notes of the Nag Hammadi codices are not included in this census because of their different nature compared to the *codified*  scribal subscriptions of later centuries.

Each colophon is identified by a specific numeric `unique identifier`.

**Colophons** are directly linked to the related **Manuscripts** by means of the CLM ID.

Colophons are carefully described, providing detailed, fully searchable, information on:
- CLM ID
- Dating
- Dialect and possible linguistic features
- Greek subscriptions, when present
- Cryptographies, when present
- Layout
- Palaeography (e.g. writing features as axis, presence of thick-and-thin style, presence of Coptic or Greek minuscule)

Prosopographical data contained in colophons texts will be soon available in a separate section of the database, named **Persons attested in colophons**.

The texts of Coptic colophons and their translation are fully searchable.

The electronic edition of colophons is made by using [Unicode](https://unicode.org)  encoding standard and [Antinoou font](https://www.evertype.com/fonts/coptic/). The ecdotic criteria are those established by the *Leydener Klammersystem*. The Egyptian month names are transliterated from the Coptic form and the toponyms and the anthroponyms are transcribed phonetically.

Beyond their inherent value as *Schenkungsurkunden* of the manuscript, Coptic colophons, as every documentary text, offer plenty of data about Medieval Egypt. They disclose to us copious evidence of the cultural, religious, economic and social milieus where the books were produced, sold, acquired, preserved and used, as well as the routes manuscripts often embarked on.
