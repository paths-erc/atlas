This section of Paths’ database contains the records of each person whose mention occurs in the text of colophons gathered in the relevant section.

Each entry, endowed with an ID number, contains a normalized form of the known onomastic and identifying information (name, patronymic, mention of carnal or spiritual relatives, ethnic, mention of the declared profession or rank, wherever specified), while the very writing occurring in the text is reported in the specific area “Other name or attestations” both in the original language (Coptic / Greek / Arabic) and in Latin transliteration. 

The crucial field “Type” defines the role played by the relevant person: mainly copyist or donor, commemorated person or simple reader of the manuscript who left a notation, but also less frequent items as restorer, deliverer, sponsor, founder and eponym, that is to say the monastic authority during whose headship (Copt. <span class="coptic">ϩⲛ̄ⲛⲉϩⲟⲟⲩ ⲛ̄-</span>) the manuscript preserving the colophon was acquired by the institution. 

The record is completed by information about the gender, the possibly expressed affiliation to any religious institution, the chronological range during which the person is attested. A link with the edition of the text allows a prompt insight into the context of the occurrence.
