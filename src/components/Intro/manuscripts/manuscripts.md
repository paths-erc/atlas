This section of the **PAThs** database contains the Coptic and bilingual Graeco-Coptic `codicological units` dated to or datable from the 3<sup>rd</sup> to the 13<sup>th</sup> century.

> A full description of the **Manuscripts** section is available at the [PAThs official documentation repository on GitHub](https://docs.paths-erc.eu/db-handbook/manuscripts.html). A [PDF version](https://github.com/paths-erc/raw/master/Pdf/paths-docs-v-0.9.pdf) is also available for offline access.

Each `codicological unit` is identified by a new, stable and unique identifier, called **Coptic Literary Manuscript** (`CLM`). When the `codicological units` have already been already classified and/or described by other projects ([Corpus dei Manoscritti Copti Letterari](http://www.cmcl.it/) mainly, but also [Trismegistos](https://www.trismegistos.org/tm/index.php), [Leuven Database of Ancient Book](https://www.trismegistos.org/ldab/), [Digital Edition of Coptic Old Testament](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/digital+edition+of+the+coptic+%28sahidic%29+old+testament/475974.html)) a reference to the respective identifiers is always provided.

To find a manuscript by its current shelfmark number, you should compose an advanced query and use both `Shelfmark: Collection` and `Shelfmark: Shelfmark` keys.

**Manuscripts** are linked to **Works**, **Titles**, **Colophons**, **Places** (distinguishing between production, storage and discovery places).

**Manuscripts** section contains all the codicological units repertoried in the [CMCL](http://www.cmcl.it/) but updates and broadens it with additions, for instance:
- The manuscripts discovered in the most recent archaeological campaigns (e.g. the hermitage of Sheikh el-Gurna, or MMA 1152, in Western Thebes; Antinoopolis)
- The ostraca from the Theban region (for which we have a well-documented archaeological context)
- Detached bindings (that is bindings without a related text block)

Single fragments are considered as `codicological units` in their own right. If they are recognized as part of a sole `codicological unit`, the identifiers may be merged.

The **PAThs** database does not include:
- Copto-Arabic manuscripts
- Liturgical manuscripts (except for those already included in the CMCL, mainly from the White Monastery)
-	Non-literary manuscripts of magical and astrological content

The database also provides a new detailed protocol of codicological description. It takes into account the most recent theoretical and terminological achievements of Greek and Latin codicology but is of course targeted at the specific features of Coptic manuscripts. An analytical description of the codicological protocol is provided in the *Manual of use*.

This model of description is easily expandable in case of a need to describe new features and can be easily queried (manually or programmatically), in order to provide scholars with an easy-to-use tool for their research.

Currently, more than 6,100 `codicological units` have been filed. Within this corpus, a complete codicological description, also including a selected bibliography, is provided for Coptic papyrus and parchment rolls and codices belonging to some of the most important ancient libraries of Christian Egypt, that is:
-	Nag Hammadi Codices
-	Bodmer Papyri (otherwise called Dishna Papers)
-	Papyrus codices from the Monastery of Saint John the Baptist of Thin
-	Codices from the hermitage of Sheikh el-Gurna
-	Codices from Antinoopolis
-	Parchment codices from the Monastery of the Archangel Michael near Phantoou
-	Parchment codices from the Monastery of Saint Macarius in the Wādī al-Naṭrūn

**PAThs** takes advantage of the invaluable data contained in the Corpus dei [Manoscritti Copti Letterari](http://www.cmcl.it/), used as a solid foundation to build a new database, that will represent a change of perspective in the study of Coptic literature. In the immediate future **PAThs** and CMCL will be kept synchronised, while in the longer term **PAThs** is meant to inherit fully the mission of the CMCL.

Manuscripts are an important means of disseminating knowledge about an ancient literature. Yet, every book has its destiny, and the destiny of Coptic manuscripts has been a very capricious one. First of all, after many centuries of flourishing production, there was neglect: when Coptic was superseded by Arabic and became a dead language, ancient Coptic manuscripts were no longer consulted and in some cases were even relegated to remote storerooms of the monasteries. Then, when the monks realised that those relics which were, in their opinion, no longer useful could raise the interest of many Western collectors, they had no scruples in taking them apart and selling them off separately in order to increase income. The result is that manuscripts from the same ancient library (e.g. the library of the White Monastery, or of the Monastery of Saint Macarius), and even portions of a single manuscript, are now scattered throughout the world in a number of different collections. In the last decades, many efforts have been made to reconstruct the dispersed Coptic libraries and their often dismembered manuscripts, or better `codicological units`. Moreover, archaeological explorations and more or less fortuitous finds have greatly enriched our knowledge of the Coptic book production, especially of its earlier phases (e.g. the Nag Hammadi Codices, the Bodmer Papyri as well as the manuscripts from the Monastery of the Archangel Michael near Phantoou).
