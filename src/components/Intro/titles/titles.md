This section of the “PAThs” Database contains the edition, with English translation, of the entire corpus of the extant Coptic titles—initial titles, final final titles, section headings, general titles, etc.—produced between the 3rd and the 11th century.

Each title is identified and marked by a specific *Clavis Coptica*, composed of a 4-digit number preceded by a “T” (to distinguish it from a *Clavis Coptica* attributed to works) and followed by a “desinense”, whose purpuse is to showing in clear manner if it is a final title or *subscriptio* (-S), an initial title or *inscriptio* (-I), a section heading (-SH), a running title (-R), a general title (-G), a general final title (-GS) or a general initial title (-GI).

Ex.:
- `T0001-I`
- `T0444-S`
- `T0234-SH01`

Titles are directly linked to the related manuscripts, by means of the “PAThs” ID, and to the works the refer to, by means of the *Clavis Coptica*.

A brief description of the decoration and of the writing (modular typology, axis, eventual presence of thick-and-thin style) is also provided.

Coptic titles can be browsed and searched in different ways, among which the easiest and most intuitive ones are by:

- *Clavis coptica* attributed to the work
- *Clavis coptica* attributed to the title
- Type (initial title, final title, etc.)
- Modular typology

The electronic edition of titles is made by using Unicode encoding standard and Antinoou font and does not represent the punctuation and the enlarged initials. Moreover, it does represent a diplomatic edition.
The Egyptian month names will be rendered in their Coptic form.

Coptic titles represent a privileged point of observation of the Coptic literary manuscript culture. Over the centuries, their position inside the manuscripts, layout, length, textual structure and even purpose has changed many times, marking crucial changes in the manufacture of the writing supports, e.g. the shift from roll to codex, and from papyrus codex to parchment codex, and marking also important passages of the history of Coptic literature, from the translations from Greek into Coptic to the production of an original literature. Moreover, the titles have often been created in a later moment than the works they are attributed to and therefore can be considered texts in their own right.

It must be stressed that Coptic titles do not represent a trustworthy “coordinate” for identification of a work (for this purpose the *Clavis Coptica* is the only possible reliable ID), since, in addition to what has just been described above, it is not rare for the same work to have circulated with different titles in different manuscripts.
Titles however represent a valuable indicator of the formation process of Coptic literature and for this reason it is important for them to be accurately classified.
