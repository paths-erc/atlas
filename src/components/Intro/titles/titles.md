This section of the **PAThs** database contains the edition, with English translation, of the entire corpus of the extant Coptic titles (currently about 700)—initial titles, final titles, section headings, general titles etc.—produced between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 13<sup>th</sup> centuries.  It updates and integrates P. Buzi, *Titoli e autori nella tradizione copta. Studio storico e tipologico*, Pisa 2005.

Each title is identified by a specific *Clavis Coptica*, composed of a 4-digit number preceded by a `T` (to distinguish it from a *Clavis Coptica*  attributed to **Works**) and followed by a suffix, clearly marking it as a final title or *subscriptio* (-S), an initial title or *inscriptio* (-I), a section heading (-SH), a running title (-R), a general title (-G), a general final title (-GS) or a general initial title (-GI).

E.g.:
- T0001-I
- T0444-S
- T0234-SH01

**Titles** are directly linked to the related **Manuscripts**, by means of the CLM ID, and to the **Works** they refer to, by means of the *Clavis Coptica*.

A brief description of the decorations and of the script (modular typology, axis, possible presence of thick-and-thin style) is also provided, when possible.

Coptic titles can be browsed and searched in a range of ways, amongst which the easiest and most intuitive ones are by:
- *Clavis Coptica* attributed to the work
- *Clavis Coptica* attributed to the title
- Type (initial title, final title, etc.)
- Modular typology

The texts of Coptic titles and their translation are fully searchable.

The electronic edition of titles is made by using [Unicode](https://unicode.org) encoding standard and [Antinoou font](https://www.evertype.com/fonts/coptic/). It does not represent the punctuation and the enlarged initials and is not a diplomatic edition. The Egyptian month names are transliterated from the Coptic form.

Coptic titles represent a preferential point of observation of the Coptic literary manuscript culture. Over the centuries, their position inside the manuscripts, layout, length, textual structure and even purpose has changed many times, marking crucial changes in the manufacture of the writing supports (e.g. the shift from roll to codex, and from papyrus codex to parchment codex) and marking also important passages of the history of Coptic literature (e.g. from the translations from Greek into Coptic to the production of original literature). Moreover, the titles have often been created at a later stage than the works to which they are attributed to and therefore can be considered texts in their own right.

It must be stressed that Coptic titles do not represent a trustworthy *coordinate* for the identification of a work (for this purpose the *Clavis Coptica* is the only possible reliable identifier), since it is not rare for the same work to have circulated with different titles in different manuscripts.

Titles, however, represent a valuable indicator of the formation process of Coptic literature and for this reason it is important for them to be accurately classified.
